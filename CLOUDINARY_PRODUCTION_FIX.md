# Cloudinary Upload Fix for Production (Render.com)

## Problem
All file uploads (profile photos, documents, payment proofs) are failing on the production server at Render.com with the error "Gagal mengupload [field]. Silakan coba lagi."

## Root Cause
The issue is likely caused by missing or incorrect Cloudinary environment variables on the production server.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Set Environment Variables on Render.com

Go to your Render.com dashboard → Your service → Environment tab and add these variables:

```bash
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dlkaphg8h
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=833124288835414
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=GEECvDFSuWx1ScE834OB6nJPQpU
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://833124288835414:GEECvDFSuWx1ScE834OB6nJPQpU@dlkaphg8h
```

### 2. Additional Environment Variables (if not set)
```bash
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
LOG_CHANNEL=stack
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

### 3. Deploy the Updated Code

Ensure your latest code with the enhanced error handling is deployed:

1. Commit all changes to your repository
2. Push to the main branch
3. Render will automatically redeploy

### 4. Verify Configuration

After deployment, check the logs on Render.com:

1. Go to your service dashboard
2. Click on "Logs" tab
3. Look for any errors related to Cloudinary configuration

### 5. Test Upload Functionality

Try uploading files and check the logs for detailed error messages that will help identify the exact issue.

## Code Changes Made

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added detailed logging for all upload attempts
- Added Cloudinary configuration checks
- Added more descriptive error messages
- Added file information in logs (size, name, type)

### Controllers Updated
- `User\DokumenController.php` - Enhanced error handling for document uploads
- `User\PengaturanController.php` - Enhanced error handling for profile photos
- `User\PembayaranController.php` - Enhanced error handling for payment proofs
- All admin controllers - Same enhancements

### Debug Routes (Development Only)
- `/debug/cloudinary` - Check Cloudinary configuration
- `/debug/cloudinary/test-upload` - Test actual upload functionality

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Cloudinary configuration missing"
**Solution**: Ensure all environment variables are set correctly on Render.com

### Issue 2: "Invalid configuration, please set up your environment"
**Solution**: Check that CLOUDINARY_URL is correctly formatted

### Issue 3: File upload timeout
**Solution**: Check file size limits and network connectivity

### Issue 4: Permission denied
**Solution**: Ensure Cloudinary API credentials have upload permissions

## Testing Steps

1. **Local Testing**: Test uploads on your local development server
2. **Production Testing**: Test uploads on the production server
3. **Log Monitoring**: Monitor logs for any error messages
4. **Cloudinary Dashboard**: Check Cloudinary dashboard for uploaded files

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor the following:

1. **Laravel Logs**: Check for detailed error messages
2. **Render Logs**: Check for deployment and runtime errors
3. **Cloudinary Dashboard**: Verify files are being uploaded
4. **User Feedback**: Monitor for user-reported issues

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist:

1. Check Render.com environment variables
2. Verify Cloudinary account status
3. Test with a minimal upload example
4. Contact Cloudinary support if needed

## Contact

If issues persist after following these steps, check:
1. Render.com service logs
